summer school projects

Effective Programming course taken during Summer School at the University of Otago.  One of the most programming intensive courses you can take as an undergraduate at Otago.  We were given tasks: 7 individual, 3 pair, and 3 group.  Some of the focuses of the projects were algorithm efficiency, string parsing, working together as a group, and using useful test data.
